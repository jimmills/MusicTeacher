# MusicTeacherUI

This app provides basic functionality for a music teacher to manage lessons and assignments for their students. It's pretty self explanatory. You can add lesson and you can add assignments to lessons. You can delete a couple things, but editing is not allowed yet.

I made heavy use of ng-bootstrap: https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home
